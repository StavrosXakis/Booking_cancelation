# Booking_cancelation Project

# Team Members:
- Giannis Panagiotopoulos
- Fotis Karamplias
- Stefanos Dimopoulos
- Stavros Xakis

# Project Description:
Guests from all over the world are welcome to our Hotels located in various places around the globe. To welcome a customer, we must prepare our facilities and have our staff ready for action. Therefore a booking cancelation of a guest would create resource expenditure that could been avoided.

# Goal:
To minimize the unnecessary costs, we build a classification model that predicts the customers about to cancel their reservation.
